No one wants to forget to renew a domain registry. Use this zenpack to keep
track of the number of days left until registration has expired.

Install the ZenPack
	Bind Devices/Templates/check_domain to a device matching your domain
name or create devices with the name matching your domain name under
/Devices/Domains. A really boreing doomsday graph is included in template.
